This project uses an Arduino Nano controller to analyze the behavior of water heating elements.
The data is collected, processed and documented to observe the performance of the heater and the changes in water temperature. 
The loop() function contains a simulation of the heating process. 
This project can be used to measure, document and understand the behavior of the heating element.
